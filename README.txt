How to publish so anyone can access it
Easiest: Quarto Pub (one command)

In the project folder, run:

quarto publish quarto-pub


Follow the prompt to sign in (one-time).
Quarto will upload the whole site and give you a public URL. Re-run the same command any time you add songs.

Also solid: GitHub Pages

Put the project in a Git repo and push to GitHub.

In the project folder, run:

quarto publish gh-pages


This creates a gh-pages branch and enables Pages automatically. You’ll get a URL like https://<your-user>.github.io/<repo>/.

Re-run the same command when you add songs.

Both options are robust and free. If you want step-by-step with GitHub (including git init, first commit, etc.), say the word and I’ll paste the exact commands.

If anything still 404s after adding songs/index.qmd, delete _site/ and re-render. Want me to add a “By Key” index or “Newest” section next?
