(Capo 2)

*Verse 1*

[C]  Our God is [G]  living  
Say, Hal-le-lu- [D] jah   
He's living [A] in us  
Say, Hal-le-lu- [D-D7] jah  
We taste His [G] riches,  
He is our [D] portion.  
[A] Just say, Oh [A7] Lord,  
To taste and [D-G-D] see

*Verse 2*

We come together,  
Thereâ€™s nothing better.  
For in the Spirit we are His family,  
His living Body!  
We just express Him.  
Jesus is our reality.  

*Verse 3*

[C] Our God is [G] living,  
He's not a [D] statue,  
Our God can [A] see us,  
our God can [D] hear, [D7] too.  
He's not an [G] idol  
of gold or [D] silver,  
[A] We serve the [A7] God  
who's real and [D-C-D] true!
