*Verse 1*

[C]  Our God is [G]  living. Say, Hal-le-lu- [D] jah   
He's living [A] in us. Say, Hal-le-lu- [D-D7] jah  
We taste His [G] riches. He is our [D] portion.  
[A] Just say, Oh [A7] Lord, To taste and [D-G-D] see

*Verse 2*

We come together. Thereâ€™s nothing better.  
For in the Spirit we are His family,  
His living Body! We just express Him.  
Jesus is our reality.  

*Verse 3*

Our God is living, He's not a statue,  
Our God can see us, our God can hear, too.  
He's not an idol of gold or silver,   
We serve the God who's real and true!
