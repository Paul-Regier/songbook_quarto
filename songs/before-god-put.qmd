[A] Before God put the [D] leaves on the [A] trees,  
Before He [E] made the [A] herbs bearing [E7] seeds,  
He [D] thought about you, and He [A] thought about me,  
And He loved us, and He [E7] loved [A] us.

Before God made the sun giving light,  
Before He placed the stars shining bright,  
He thought about you, and He thought about me,  
And He loved us, and He loved us.

Before God put the clouds in the sky,  
Before He taught the birds how to fly,  
He thought about you, and He thought about me,  
And He loved us, and He loved us.

Before God put the whales in the sea,  
Before He made the fish swimming free,  
He thought about you, and He thought about me,  
And He loved us, and He loved us.

Before God made the cattle and sheep,  
Before He made the insects that creep,  
He thought about you and He thought about me,  
And He loved us, and He loved us.
