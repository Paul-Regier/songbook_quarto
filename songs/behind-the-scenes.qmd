*Verse 1  *

[E] Be- [A] hind the scenes, be- [E] hind the scenes  
The [B] hea vens [B7] rule in [E] everything.  
Our [A] prayers are heard! God [E] sends His Word;  
Be [B] strong, be [B7] peaceful, and be [E] strong.

*Verse 2  *

When troubles come, go find a chum;  
Together we can overcome!  
Just step away, take time to pray!  
Request compassions of our God.  

*Verse 3  *

God grants, God gives, God makes us live;  
We’re His — our ways belong to Him.  
Because, behind the scenes, behind the scenes,  
The heavens rule in everything.
