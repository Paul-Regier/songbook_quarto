<div class="song">

You [D] can’t always trust what you [A] see.  
You [A7] might end up being [D] deceived.  
If [G] Israel got [Em] fooled, then [D] how about [Bm] you?  
You [Em] can’t always [A] trust what you [D] see. 


The Gibeonites were disguised.  
That took Israel by surprise.  
Much trouble occurred, not seeking the Lord.  
But acting according to sight.  


Things aren’t always as they appear.  
So turn to the Lord, He’s so near.  
His Word is your light, walk by faith not sight.  
Things aren’t always as they appear.
