*Verse 1*  

[D] Lord, You [A] are more [G] precious than [D] silver.  
Lord, You [A] are more [G] costly than [A] gold.  
[D] Lord, You [A] are more [G] beautiful than [D] diamonds.  
And [G] nothing I de- [A] sire com- [A7] pares to [D] You!  

*Verse 2*  

Lord, Your life is divine, eternal.  
Lord, Your life regenerated me.  
Lord, Your life is growing within me,  
Until I am fully conformed to Thee.  

*Verse 3*  

Lord, Your love is wider than the ocean.  
Lord, Your love is deeper than the sea.  
Lord, Your love encompasses the nations,  
And that is all I want to live in me.  

*Verse 4*  

Lord, Your light is shining within us;  
Lord, Your light drives darkness away.  
Lord, Your light is guiding us onwards,  
Preparing us for the coming wedding day.
