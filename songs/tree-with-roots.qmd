<div class="song">

[C] I am a tree with roots  
By the [F] river of living [G] water,  
[C] Trials still may [Am] come,  
But they [F] end in victo- [G] ry.  
And [F] even in the [C] wilder- [Am] ness,  
When [Dm] there’s no hope at [G] all,  
[Dm] I have roots by the [G] river of the [C] Lord. [C7]

When the [F] scorching sun [C] arrives,  
My [E] leaves won’t wither and [Am] die,  
[F] I have roots by the [G] river of the [C-F-C] Lord.
